## Context (Project setting up)

### Problematic 
Can we combine video game data with real event to have a new point of view of games ? Will a such connection convince gamers and football fans to have a statistical approach ?


### Motivation 

UEFA EURO 2020 will begin on June 11th, 2021, this competition, delayed due to the pandemic is highly anticipated by football fans all over the world.  Such international event is the source of many discussions between friends on each team strength and weakness. Our main motivation is to connect real life national teams with football most popular game, FIFA. This connection will give a more statistical approach over future confrontation, and will add arguments in fans discussions. Even if sport cannot be bounds by statistics it still give a new point of view on a match. 
We can sum up our objectives by :
-	Give fans an easy access to data 
-	Offer general comparisons between teams (offense/defense)
-	


### Dataset 
As said above, we want to join two different type of data, the national teams composition and Fifa game dataset that give access to every professional football player rate on every aspect of his game.  

Fifa dataset is available on Kaggle, for free, and give access to every player rating. The data do not comport club composition or national team composition. As expected from such a standard of games, the dataset has no impurity or missing values. We didnâ€™t need any cleaning. 

### EDA 

In a other way we do need a lot of preprocessing. The main problem we faced was the absence of national team, this is mainly due because each team manager call at the very end of a preparation period his 23 players. To have access to that information we had to scrape a well informed website. The website is in german so we had to translate each team name as a first step.  
After scraping we could group players on each national team and compute some basic statistics. 

We can see the average age per national team : [picture]

Or even the overall rating [picture] 

Those statistics give us a first sight of how we can extract information to make it easier for user to access it.
