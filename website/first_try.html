                What color can a wine be ? Easy, we all know that : red, white
                and rosé. Well... Yes but not exactly. If it is true that
                everyone has been classifying wine into these three main
                categories for years, a wine color's is far more important and
                complex than those threes simple categories. The range of
                colors of wine is infinite. There exists hundreds of names and
                adjectives for describing the color of wine. It is a really
                complex science. However, without getting that much into
                details, we can still get a good understanding of the main
                characteristics of the different colors and the effect they
                have on the taste of the wine. Because yes, before even
                tasting a wine, we can guess a lot about its taste only
                looking at it. But obviously it takes a lifetime of learning
                before being able to do that. First we need to quickly
                understand how to describe a color.

                <strong class="text-white">white</strong>) and its tasting
                characteristics. Obviously, wine is not an exact science but
                in most of the cases, these are true. In the last slide,
                you'll be able to discover notable tints and their associated
                characteristics.
                <br />
                And <strong class="text-rose">rosé</strong> ? I can only tell
                you one thing : Rosé is not made from mixing red and white
                wines ! Rosé wines are stained pink by macerating the skins of
                red grapes over an average period of 4 hours to 4 days.

                There is a quite strong connection between the color of red

                  Generally, red wines
                  <strong>lose color as they age.</strong> Their tint tends to
                  turn to garnet/brown colors.

                  Red wines that are <strong>more opaque</strong> generally
                  contain higher levels of tannin(Nebbiolo is an exception to
                  this rule).

                <li>
                  Red wines with higher sulfite additions have

                <li>
                  The <strong>hue</strong> in red wine is partially affected

              </h3>
              <p>
                On the white wine side, it is a bit less straightforward.
                However, with experience, we can still guess a lot of
                interesting things.
              </p>
              <ul class="list-indent-left">
                <li>
                  <strong>Star bright wines</strong> tend to be light bodied,
                  young, have high acidity and are filtered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In contrast, a wine that a
                  <strong>dim yellow color</strong> has a lot more pigment in
                  it and could be a much richer older wine. These wines could
                  be dim because of age or because of sweetness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  White wines tend to <strong>darken</strong> as they age
                  turning to deeper gold or yellow colors eventually turning
                  brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <strong>saturation</strong> of color in a white wine can
                  indicate the richness of the wine. A very
                  <strong>pale</strong> chardonnay is unoaked and zesty. A
                  <strong>saturated</strong> golden chardonnay will most
                  likely be oaked and buttery in style. Additionally, sweeter
                  wines then have more pigment into them resulting in higher
                  saturation. A sweet Sauterne is bright yellow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wines that have <strong>green hues </strong>to them are more
                  savory, with grassy green flavors like bell pepper, white
                  pepper, green bean and limes whereas wines that have more
                  <strong>golden-copper yellow hues</strong> tend to have more
                  fruity notes to them such as apricot, peach, orange and
                  pineapple.

                  The odor of each wine is unique and recognizing every
                  different scent can be a challenge. To make it easier, we
                  classified the most common scent in different categories:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Primary aromas</b> are scents that our nose detect that
                  are specific to the grape variety (or varieties) used to
                  make the wine. The primary aromas can vary depending on the climate and the soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Secondary aromas</b> are scents due to chemical changes
                  effected on the wine by the process of fermentation. The natural flavors present in the grapes
                  interact with yeasts and bacteria that run the fermentation to create further aromas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Tertiary aromas</b> are smells we associate with wine
                  aging. Wine molecules interact with each other and with oxygen, creating new flavors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Fault and Other</b> are unwanted ordors that can be
                  present due to some winemaking practice or poor storage
                  condition.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="column is-one-third">
                <p>
                  To capture most aromas, we advice you to take short breaths
                  through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. We
                  will dive into the different scents in two steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First your <b>first nose</b> consists of one sniff. With
                  this sniff, you should try to identify one family of odor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, swirl the wine to release the different aromas and for
                  the different families, try to identify the exact scents of
                  the wine.

                  Training your taste buds to recognize subtle tastes in wine
                  takes years of experience. For now, let's focus on 5 simple
                  traits that anyone can feel. Take a good sip from your glass
                  and make sure to swish it around in your mouth before
                  swallowing, to get the full effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Sweetness</b> in wine is primarily from grape sugars that
                  are leftover after fermentation, and is less perceivable in
                  wines with higher acidity. <b>Tannin</b>, found mostly in red
                  wine, gives a drying sensation to your tongue. High tannin
                  wines will grip the insides of your lips to your teeth. It can
                  also give a bitter taste to the wine. <b>Acidity</b> is the
                  level of sourness in wine, it makes your mouth water. Low acid
                  wines generally taste round or even flabby and high acid wines
                  taste lighter in body and very tart. The level of
                  <b>alcohol</b> is felt in your throat as a warming sensation.
                  All these traits come together to give you a sense of the
                  wine's <b>overall body</b>. It is essentially a measure of how
                  bold it tastes in your mouth.

                If you didn't manage to identify the grape variety, don't
                worry ! As mentioned, it takes a lot of practice. Furthermore,
                to make things even more complex, many winemakers choose to
                combine different grape varieties (as opposed to using just
                one) to achieve a very specific taste. However, getting
                familiar with the taste profiles of well know grape varieties
                is already a great starting point, so you can explore them
                here by using the search bar.

                  Imagine you have this one bottle that you got from a relative
                  a couple years ago that you've been eagerly waiting to open,
                  so you design your dish by selecting ingredients to match the
                  wine. Or you are meeting your partner who just cooked a
                  delicious meal and you want to bring the perfect wine to go
                  with the dish. In both cases, we are talking about the complex
                  art of pairing wine with food. The basics however, are pretty
                  simple to learn, so that you never again will have to spend an
                  eternity staring at the dozens of wine bottles in the wine
                  section of your local supermarket, not having a clue about
                  which one to choose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pairings can <b>complement</b> two tastes, balancing them out.
                  A typical example is combining high fat foods such as melted
                  cheese with a highly acid wine. On the other hand, pairings
                  can <b>reinforce</b> a taste, if the wine and food share a
                  common trait, such as smokiness or creaminess.
                </p>

                  So always ask yourself what the strongest savors of the dish
                  are, and try to create either a complementary or reinforcing
                  pairing. Of course, a dish can be itself composed of multiple
                  strong savors, in which case the wine can create multiple
                  pairings (both complementary and reinforcing). This type of
                  pairing is more interesting but also harder to do, so focusing
                  on the primary savor is enough for most cases.

                  Even though there isn't a magic formula, here are a couple of
                  simple guidelines that can help you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the wine should be more acidic than the food</li>
                  <li>the wine should be sweeter than the food</li>
                  <li>
                    the wine should have the same flavor intensity as the food
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    red wines pair best with bold flavored meats (e.g. red meat)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    white wines pair best with lighter meats (e.g. fish or chicken)
                  </li>
                  <li>bitter wines are best balanced with fat</li>
                </ul>
