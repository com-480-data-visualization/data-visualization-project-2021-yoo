### Problematic

We aim to create a visualization to compare the teams participating in the upcoming EURO 2020 competition.

#### Motivation:
The EURO competition is considered by many the second biggest competition football(the most popular sport) in the world. Fans passionately follow the competition every 4 years. They normally tend to discuss matches with friends beforehand, and some place bets on certain teams(friendly or with booking agencies). For these reasons, we are trying to create an online tool that people can use to compare two teams head to head before their matches to see how they stack up against each other.


#### Overview:
We are trying to include multiple features in the comparisons for people to be able to have fun and make informed decisions when they place their bets:
1. General comparisons between teams attack, midfield and defense according to stats.
1. Show stats that correlate with some simple strategies to expose teams' weaknesses and strengths.
1. Show odds according to betting agencies.
1. Show the current form of these teams

#### Target audience:
We are targeting football fans and especially people who like betting on football matches.
