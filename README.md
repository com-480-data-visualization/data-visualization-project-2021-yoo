The aspect of the game filter apply for both chart, but position do not apply on the radar chart as it a team average. 

The main aspect of this page is interactivity, users can select specific player on the parallele chart. 

After this each team have a specific page to seek overall statistic of players. Every teams player are displayed and can be search in a table thanks to position filter or a search bar.
