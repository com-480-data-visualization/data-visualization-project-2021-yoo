> - What others have already done with the data?

As we could have expected Fifa dataset have been explored by many others people. For every year Fifa game edition there are several data visualization work on it. Those work are easy to find as people put them online, the goal is to give access to chart and plot to show interesting data for football fans, such as average year per championship, most represented country in the game and other statistics. 

Those visualization give a good overview of the dataset, that can help us to see opportunities that we can do with this dataset. 

The main difference is that we want to do more specifics visuals, more precisely on national teams for international event. 

We were not able to find such a work, especially with the same Dataset. Indeed some studies are related with World's Cup statistics but they don't rely on the same dataset. 



> - Why is your approach original?

How approach rely on international event and the main goal is to give a good overview of nationals player that will play agaisnt each other, and also statistics about both team, there statistics weaknesses or forces.

The originality is in the fact that it will bring an overview of games for every one, within giving names of player that can interest as well strong fans and more casual ones. 


> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).

The idea come from having a dataset with data that can reach almost every human on Earth, and in meanwhile serving global interest to informs fans on their teams and opponents. 

A common football team representation is picture place at each position and in the background a football pitch. For the plot appearance, something understandable and nice to watch is better.  That's why we look at sports magazine representation. But as it will be online we will use interactions to give life to the data. 

> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.

None of us already use this dataset.
